Idea:
 In our project, we will be making a simple
 database for an Airplane. We will first clarify
 the business rules and decide the proper
 relationships between the entities. So, after
 everything is clear and organized, we will be
 moving to the next step which is creating the ER
 and UML diagrams. Those are going to be the
 base for us to build the database.
 
 Programming Language for interfaces:
 DataBase
 Sql
